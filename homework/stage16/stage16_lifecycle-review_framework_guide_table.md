# Applied Financial Engineering — Framework Guide Template

This Framework Guide is a structured reflection tool.  
Fill it in as you progress through the course or at the end of your project.  
It will help you connect each stage of the **Applied Financial Engineering Lifecycle** to your own project, and create a portfolio-ready artifact.

---

## How to Use
- Each row corresponds to one stage in the lifecycle.  
- Use the prompts to guide your answers.  
- Be concise but specific — 2–4 sentences per cell is often enough.  
- This is **not a test prep sheet**. It’s a way to *document, reflect, and demonstrate* your process.

## Framework Guide Table

| Lifecycle Stage | What You Did | Challenges | Solutions / Decisions | Future Improvements |
|-----------------|--------------|------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| **1. Problem Framing & Scoping** | *(What was the financial problem? What were the goals, constraints, assumptions?)* | *(What made scoping tricky? Competing objectives? Ambiguity?)* | *(How did you resolve scope, define success metrics?)* | *(How could you frame/clarify better next time?)* |
| **2. Tooling Setup** | *(Which tools, libraries, or infra did you configure?)* | *(Any environment/dependency issues?)* | *(How did you resolve setup problems?)* | *(What would you automate or streamline?)* |
| **3. Python Fundamentals** | *(Which core Python/data skills did you apply?)* | *(Any gaps in coding fluency?)* | *(How did you close them — e.g., code reviews, practice?)* | *(What skills should you keep strengthening?)* |
| **4. Data Acquisition / Ingestion** | *(Where did your data come from? APIs, CSVs, databases?)* | *(Any access/cleanliness issues?)* | *(How did you structure ingestion pipelines?)* | *(What would you improve — e.g., robustness, automation?)* |
| **5. Data Storage** | *(Where/how did you store your data?)* | *(Any challenges with formats, schema, or scale?)* | *(Which design choices did you make?)* | *(What storage improvements would help?)* |
| **6. Data Preprocessing** | *(What preprocessing/cleaning steps did you run?)* | *(Which data quality issues caused trouble?)* | *(How did you decide on imputation, normalization, etc.?)* | *(How could preprocessing be improved?)* |
| **7. Outlier Analysis** | *(How did you detect anomalies or unusual events?)* | *(What was hard to interpret — error vs real event?)* | *(How did you decide whether to drop, cap, or keep outliers?)* | *(What techniques would you add next time?)* |
| **8. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** | *(Which visualizations, summaries, or diagnostics did you use?)* | *(Which insights were unclear or misleading?)* | *(How did you clarify patterns, distributions, correlations?)* | *(What extra EDA would help?)* |
| **9. Feature Engineering** | *(What features did you construct? Technical indicators, lags, ratios?)* | *(Which features were difficult to design or justify?)* | *(How did you validate usefulness of features?)* | *(What domain-driven features could you add?)* |
| **10. Modeling (Regression / Time Series / Classification)** | *(Which models did you try and why?)* | *(What challenges arose — overfitting, convergence, runtime?)* | *(How did you choose/tune the final model?)* | *(What alternative models would you try in future?)* |
| **11. Evaluation & Risk Communication** | *(Which metrics did you evaluate?)* | *(Which assumptions/risks were most concerning?)* | *(How did you communicate uncertainty, error, tradeoffs?)* | *(What evaluation methods would improve robustness?)* |
| **12. Results Reporting, Delivery Design & Stakeholder Communication** | *(How did you present results? Slides, reports, dashboards?)* | *(What was difficult to explain to non-technical stakeholders?)* | *(What delivery choices helped communication land?)* | *(What would you change in delivery/communication?)* |
| **13. Productization** | *(How did you prepare the model/data pipeline for production use?)* | *(What issues arose around scalability, maintainability?)* | *(What design decisions ensured reliability?)* | *(What productization steps would you add?)* |
| **14. Deployment & Monitoring** | *(How did you deploy your solution?)* | *(What monitoring or alerting challenges did you face?)* | *(How did you track model drift or system performance?)* | *(What would you upgrade in deployment/monitoring?)* |
| **15. Orchestration & System Design** | *(How did you integrate tasks into workflows/pipelines?)* | *(What complexity or dependency issues appeared?)* | *(How did you solve orchestration problems?)* | *(What would you change in system design?)* |
| **16. Lifecycle Review & Reflection** | *(What are your biggest takeaways from the full lifecycle?)* | *(Where did you struggle the most?)* | *(What patterns or strategies helped across multiple stages?)* | *(What would you do differently in your next project?)* |

## Reflection Prompts

- Which stage was the most **difficult** for you, and why?  
- Which stage was the most **rewarding**?  
- How do the stages **connect** — where did one stage’s decisions constrain or enable later stages?  
- If you repeated this project, what would you **do differently across the lifecycle**?  
- Which skills do you most want to **strengthen** before your next financial engineering project?
