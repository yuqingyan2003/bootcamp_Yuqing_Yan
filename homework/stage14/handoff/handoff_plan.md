 # AAPL Stock Prediction Model - Handoff Plan

## Deployment Path

### Phase 1: Pre-deployment (Week 1)
- **Model Registration**: Upload trained model to ML registry with version tags
- **Infrastructure Setup**: Provision API containers, monitoring stack, alerting rules
- **Integration Testing**: Validate API endpoints with synthetic data and load testing
- **Runbook Creation**: Document troubleshooting steps, escalation paths, rollback procedures

### Phase 2: Staged Rollout (Week 2)
- **Shadow Mode**: Deploy model alongside existing system, log predictions without serving
- **A/B Testing**: Route 10% of traffic to new model, compare performance metrics
- **Monitoring Validation**: Confirm all four-layer metrics are collecting properly
- **Feedback Loop**: Gather user feedback and performance data for optimization

### Phase 3: Full Production (Week 3)
- **Complete Migration**: Route 100% of prediction requests to new model
- **Documentation Handoff**: Transfer ownership documents to production teams
- **Training Sessions**: Conduct knowledge transfer sessions for operations staff
- **Go-live Support**: Data Science team provides 24/7 support for first week
