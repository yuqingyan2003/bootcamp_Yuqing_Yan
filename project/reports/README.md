## Problem Statement & Business Context

Individual investors often lack sophisticated tools and expertise to analyze stock price trends and make data-driven predictions. This project addresses this gap by building a comprehensive, reproducible pipeline that automatically collects, cleans, and analyzes daily stock data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) throughout 2023.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Develop automated data collection and preprocessing capabilities
- Create interpretable machine learning models for price prediction
- Implement risk-aware evaluation and uncertainty communication
- Build production-ready system with monitoring and reliability features

**Target Stakeholders:**
- **Primary**: Individual retail investors seeking data-driven investment insights
- **Secondary**: Financial educators and bloggers requiring analytical tools
- **Tertiary**: Data science practitioners learning financial engineering applications

## Stakeholder & User

- **Stakeholder:** Retail investors, financial bloggers, and educators seeking to empower individuals with better stock analytics.
- **User:** Individual investors who want to track, analyze, and forecast Apple stock performance as part of their investment workflow. Users interact with the output via notebooks, dashboards, or reports, typically before making buy/sell/hold decisions.

## Useful Answer & Decision

- **Descriptive:** What are the historical trends, volatility, and outliers in AAPL stock prices in 2023?
- **Predictive:** What is the expected closing price of AAPL in the next week/month, based on regression analysis?

## Assumptions & Constraints

- Data is sourced from Yahoo Finance via yfinance, covering only daily OHLCV for AAPL in 2023.
- Missing values in numeric columns are filled with the median; columns with >50% missing are dropped.
- Outliers are detected using the IQR method and visualized with boxplots; extreme outliers may be removed or flagged.
- Data is assumed accurate as provided by the API; API access may be rate-limited or temporarily unavailable.
- The pipeline is for educational and personal use, not for professional trading.

## Known Unknowns / Risks

- API outages, changes, or deprecation.
- Missing or inconsistent data for certain dates.
- Unforeseen market events (e.g., splits, mergers) not reflected in the data.
- Model overfitting due to limited features or short timeframes.

## Data Cleaning Strategy

Use a modular and reproducible pipeline for data cleaning, implemented in `src/cleaning.py`:
- **Filling missing values:** Numeric columns are filled with the median (robust to outliers).
- **Dropping columns:** Columns with >50% missing values are dropped.
- **Scaling:** Numeric features are scaled to [0, 1] for comparability.
- **Outlier detection:** IQR method is used to flag or remove extreme values.
- **Visual comparison:** Distributions and missingness are visualized before and after cleaning.

All cleaning steps are implemented as reusable functions, ensuring transparency and reproducibility for future datasets.
